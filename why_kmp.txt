For implementing the regex functions I used Knuth Morris pratt algorithm. The reasons for using KMP algorithm over other algorithms are,
1. It uses a table to store information about patterns. This allows the algorithm to skip over parts of the text that it knows cannot match the pattern
2. Because of the above reason the linear time complexity is of O(n+m), hence linear time complexity, therefore it is better for large corpus of text.
3. Comparatively easier to implement, since a dynamic programming approach is used that do not have backtracking.
4. overall performance of algorithm for substring matching is good.
